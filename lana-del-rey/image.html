            <h2>Early Reception</h2>
            <p>Prior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.[265][266][267] One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant and posted music videos on YouTube, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.[266] Harris wrote:</p>
            <p class="long-quote">The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the "authenticity" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.[266]</p>
            <p>Tony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against allegations that she was a product of her record label: "To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant."[37] In Del Rey's own words, she "[n]ever had a persona. Never needed one. Never will."[268]</p>
            <p>In a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, "I didn't edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork."[269]</p>

        <h2>Social Views</h2>
        <p>Having been labeled as antifeminist by multiple sources,[74][35][76] Del Rey stated in 2014: "For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in ... SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism ... I'm just not really that interested."[270] She also said:</p>
        <p class="long-quote">For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a personal analysis.[271]</p>
        <p>In 2017, Del Rey further clarified her updated view on feminism in an interview with Pitchfork:[272]</p>
        <p class="long-quote">Because things have shifted culturally. It's more appropriate now than under the Obama administration, where at least everyone I knew felt safe. It was a good time. We were on the up-and-up... Women started to feel less safe under [the Trump] administration instantly. What if they take away Planned Parenthood? What if we can't get birth control? Now, when people ask me those questions, I feel a little differently...[272]</p>
        <p>Following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases, she voiced her support for the Me Too movement[273] and identified herself as a feminist. In 2020, she voiced her support for a third wave of feminism.[172]</p>
        <p>In May of that year, she attracted criticism for an Instagram post defending herself against accusations of glamorizing abuse in part by pointing out an array of other female artists and their successes with works about "imperfect sexual relationships".[274][275][276] Del Rey responded to the criticism that race was the theme of her post by saying that she mentioned the singers she did because she "[loves] these singers and [knows] them".[277] She clarified that she was referencing those "who don't look strong or necessarily smart, or like they're in control etc.," when she mentioned people "who look like [her]".[278] Del Rey attracted further criticism for briefly posting a video of looters during the George Floyd protests in May 2020.[279]</p>
        <p>Del Rey has frequently been critical of former U.S. President Donald Trump. She has described him as being a narcissist and a product of a culture of sociopathy, stating his mental state makes him devoid of any understanding of what his words and actions can lead to.[280] In January 2021, Del Rey incited commentary for stating Trump "[didn't] know that he's inciting a riot" as a result of his "delusions of grandeur".[281] She was critical of Kanye West in 2018 for his support of former President Trump.[282] During the first year of Trump's presidency, Del Rey alleged she attempted to use witchcraft against Trump.[283] In November 2020, Del Rey honored Joe Biden's election as President of the United States by covering "On Eagles' Wings".[284]</p>
        <p>During the release of the artwork for Chemtrails Over the Country Club on Instagram, Del Rey gained widespread press coverage for suggesting that her friends, featured on the cover, were "a beautiful mix of everything", saying that she had always been "inclusive without even trying to" throughout her career.[281][285] Del Rey elaborated, saying her close friends and boyfriends had been "rappers" and addressed her critics, saying that before commenters turned it into a "WOC/POC issue", she "wasn't the one storming the capital" and was "changing the world by putting my life and thoughts and love out there".[286][287] She subsequently deleted the comments.[281][288] Following criticism from media outlets, Del Rey tweeted "A woman still can't get mad right? Even when a mob mentality tries to *incite*."[281]</p>

        <h2>Charity Work</h2>
        <p>Over the years, Del Rey has supported multiple causes and made several recordings available as offerings to help support causes she believes in. Her 2019 single "Looking for America" was released in response to the August 3â€“4, 2019, mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, with all proceeds from the song going to relief funds benefiting victims of the August shootings and the July 28, 2019, Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting.[289] In October 2020, she donated $350,000 from the sales of her book Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass to DigDeep,[290] a Los-Angeles-based[291] non-profit organization, founded by George McGraw in 2014, which provides electric-pumped[292] water for some of the most remote[293] families and communities[292] of Navajo Nation.[294] Later in December, Del Rey released a cover of "You'll Never Walk Alone" to benefit charities supported by the Liverpool F.C. Foundation.[295]</p>
        <p>In the early 2000s, Del Rey worked at a homeless shelter and participated in humanitarian work, including building houses at Navajo Nation.[296]</p>
