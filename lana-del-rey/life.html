            <p>Elizabeth Grant was born on June 21, 1985,[14] in Manhattan, New York City,[15] to Robert England Grant Jr., a copywriter at Grey Group, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Hill), an account executive at the same organization.[16][17][18] She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant,[19] and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.[20][21] She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent.[22][23] When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York.[24] In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[25] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[26] There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years[21] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[21][27]</p>
            <p>She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year,[26] but when she was 14[28] or 15,[29] her parents sent her to Kent School[30] to get sober from alcoholism. Grant shared in an interview: "That's really why I got sent to boarding school aged 14—to get sober."[28] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.[31] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.[32][33] She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation:</p>
            <p class="long-quote">When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life.[34]</p>
            <p>After graduating from Kent School, she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle and working as a waitress.[25] During this time, Grant's uncle taught her to play guitar and she "realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords".[35] Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena".[35] "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously", she said. "When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn—I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point—and that was it."[15]</p>
            <p>In fall 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx, New York City, where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[15] She has said she chose to study the subject because it "bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why."[15]</p>
