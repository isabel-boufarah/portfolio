                <h4>Front End Design & Development</h4>
                <p>To Compete is a scroll based experience meant to describe what it means to compete as an athlete. From setting goals to celebrating post race, I hope to relay the emotional highs and consistent training I share with my teammates.</p>

                <h4>UX Research Case Study</h4>
                <p>As a college athlete, I have experienced myself and witnessed my teammates suffer through long injuries, battling with themselves and the support around them, trying to reach the finish line. As a junior I was well versed in this problem and decided it needed a solution. I tasked myself with understanding the needs, goals and pain points of injured athletes in order to improve the injury experience as a student athlete.</p>

                <h4>Front End Design & Development</h4>
                <p>Given the topic of Lana Del Rey, I designed and implemented an informational site to showcase her career and style. I used inspiration from Lana Del Rey's most recent album in order to stay true to her aesthetic. I also made sure to build a fully responsive site, allowing for a positive experience on any screen.</p>

                <h4>Front End Design & Development</h4>
                <p>Using React, I designed and implemented the Games page for Student Life Newspaper at WashU. Users can quickly view today's crossword puzzle and easily navigate through the archive of puzzles. After implementing the React app, I worked closely with Zach Cohn to integrate the page into Wordpress.</p>
